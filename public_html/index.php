				<p>My name is James Montoya and I am an artist.  I grew up in Santa Fe but have been living in Albuquerque since 2003. Growing up in Santa Fe close to the world famous Canyon Road, I was exposed to many artists and artwork from around the world.  My elementary school was very art forcused and nutured my artistic talents.  Today I show my work in Denver CO, Phoenix AZ, and of course all over Albuquerque.  </p>
